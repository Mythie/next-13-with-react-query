# Next 13 with React Query

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/mythie/next-13-with-react-query/tree/main)

This is a simple example of Next 13 with React Query for retrieving data in React Server Components and then hydrating it for usage on client components.

This allows for layouts to perform larger and more general state hydrations with `<Hydrate />` while pages can prefetch data that will be set using initial data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
